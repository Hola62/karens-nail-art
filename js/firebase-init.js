/*
 Firebase init stub (keys removed)

 The real Firebase client configuration has been removed from the repository for security.
 To enable Firebase locally or in your deployment, copy `js/firebase-init.example.js`
 to `js/firebase-init.js` and fill in the placeholder values with your project's
 credentials. Then deploy using environment-specific secret management.

 This stub intentionally does not initialize Firebase and only warns at runtime.
 It keeps the `<script type="module" src="js/firebase-init.js"></script>` include
 safe to load without exposing secrets.

    // No-op stub to avoid runtime errors in pages that expect Firebase to be present.
